# PL/SQL Project

## Overview

This project contains PL/SQL scripts for Oracle database interactions, featuring functions, stored procedures, and anonymous blocks.

## Components

### Functions

- **Functions** are reusable code blocks that perform specific tasks and return a value. In this project, the `calculate_salary` function computes the net salary of an employee based on inputs.

### Stored Procedures

- **Stored Procedures** are named sets of PL/SQL statements stored in the database. The `insert_customer` procedure adds a new customer to the customer table, typically used for encapsulating business logic or performing specific database tasks.

### Anonymous Blocks

- **Anonymous Blocks** are unnamed code sections, often used for one-time execution or ad-hoc tasks. The `example_anonymous_block` demonstrates updating an employee's hiring date.

## Requirements

- Oracle Database installed.
- Privileges for executing functions and stored procedures.

## Usage

1. Execute the provided scripts in Oracle SQL Developer or any Oracle database administration tool.
2. Ensure necessary privileges for function and stored procedure execution.
3. Utilize anonymous blocks as templates for creating custom scripts tailored to your needs.
