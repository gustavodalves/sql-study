# SQL Query Examples

## Overview

This project provides SQL query examples for various scenarios, explaining the concepts of joins, functions, subselects, and auto-relationships.

## Concepts

### Joins

- **Joins** in SQL are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. They are essential for retrieving data that spans multiple tables in a database.

### Functions

- **Functions** in SQL allow you to encapsulate logic and perform operations on data. They are reusable blocks of code that can be called within queries, providing a way to calculate values or manipulate data.

### Subselects

- **Subselects** (or subqueries) in SQL involve nesting one query within another. They are useful for retrieving data from a subset of records based on certain conditions defined in the outer query.

### Auto-Relationship

- **Auto-Relationship** refers to self-joins in SQL, where a table is joined with itself. This is commonly used to represent hierarchical relationships within a single table, such as an employee hierarchy.

## Requirements

- SQL database installed.
- Appropriate privileges for executing queries, functions, and self-joins.

## Usage

1. Review the SQL scripts provided for each concept.
2. Execute the scripts in your preferred SQL database management tool.
3. Ensure necessary privileges for query execution and function usage.
4. Understand the examples to apply similar concepts in your specific use cases.
